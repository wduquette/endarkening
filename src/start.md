# Start: Founding of the Free City of Pognor (Light)

Founding of the Free City of Pognor by members of the Baklahvite Clan.

## 1B. Escape of Todd and Flora Han

Todd and Flora Han escape the Darkworld by ascending the Great Chasm in a
balloon.  The balloon traverses the peaks of the Rim Mountains and lands in
the fields of one Dom Teravich Lytskya. Flora is 6 months pregnant with
their first child at the time.

## 1A. The Coming of the Clans to Pognor (Light)

The Bakhlavites turn to make a stand against their Corovian oppressors
at the village of Pognor, where Dom Teravich Lytskya succeeds in baking the
first Bahklavite war-golem with the aid of clan-members skilled in the
Five Elements.  Lytskya's rise in the clan dates to this event.

## 1C. Apprenticeship of Tomen Han (Light)

Promising young Tomen Han (son of Flora and Todd) is officially apprenticed to
Baker Dom Teravich Lytskya, a move that is considered highly controversial in
light of the young manâ€™s origins.
