# 1D. The Golden Age (Light)

The Pognorite Hegemony is at its cultural and economic height, having
annexed some neighbors and bound the others to it via commercial
treaties.  The airships of the Pognorite Merchant Marine bring the delicacies
and treasures of the world back to the City of Pognor.  The citizens of the
Hegemony are cultured and prosperous.  Meanwhile, the House of Lytskya and
the other houses of the Bakhlavite Clan are becoming decadent in their tastes.

## 1E. Herzog Mammentrap goes to Pognor (Light)

Herzog Mammentrap, a farmer from the province of Corovia, fulfills his
life-long dream of visiting the capital city of the Hegemony.  According to
Mammentrap family traditions, the family farm once belonged to Dom Teravich
Lytskya, the First Archbaker of Pognor.  That was before the Bakhlavites fled
Corovia, back in the old days.  And is he impressed?  I should say he
is!  Herzog is impressed by everything he sees: the paved streets, the marble
towers, the ranks of Bakhlavite War Golems standing guard before the Hegemon's
Palace.  He has an aethercrafter make a picture of him standing in front of
Dom Teravich's statue in  Bakhlavite Square, with the facade of the great Clan
House in the background.  He spends two weeks in Pognor, all told, and the
next twenty years boring his neighbors back home in Lesser Stewey.
