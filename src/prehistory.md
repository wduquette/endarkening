# Prehistory

The "prehistory" period is for events that are ancient history with respect to
the time from the Start to the End periods, that are in some way
foundational.  Events in the "prehistory" shouldn't depend on each other; we
aren't trying to flesh out what happened before the
[Start Period](start.md).  

## 3A. Exile of the Aether-Cursed (Dark)

Believing aetheric magic to be a curse, primitive Corovians force the
immediate exile of anyone who exhibits signs of aetheric magic. They are sent
in the dark of night with little fanfare along the Great Descent into the
Darkworld by the Corovian elders. Those that ‘disappear’ are spoken of in
whispers as though their very names contain a curse. Some daring children
sneak to the edge of the Rim on dark nights to peer into the Chasm. Some say
that they have seen the fires down below. Some say if you stare too long into
the deep darkness of the abyss you will go mad and join them.
