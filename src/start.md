# Start: Founding of the Free City of Pognor (Light)

Founding of the Free City of Pognor by members of the Baklahvite Clan.

## The Coming of the Clans to Pognor (Light)

(WD,1) The Bakhlavites turn to make a stand against their Corovian oppressors
at the village of Pognor, where Dom Teravich Lytskya succeeds in baking the
first Bahklavite war-golem with the aid of clan-members skilled in the
Five Elements.  Lytskya's rise in the clan dates to this event.
